### Minor Changes

- 0a57065: Make the default corner radius rounder, HeroUI-style.

  The `--radius-kun-*` scale grows so the default control radius lands at HeroUI's
  12px (it was 8px):

  | bucket | before      | after |
  | ------ | ----------- | ----- |
  | sm     | 4px         | 6px   |
  | md     | 12 ←default | 12px  |
  | lg     | 12px        | 16px  |

  `md` (every component's default) is now **12px**, `lg` (floating panels — dropdown
  / context-menu / toast) is **16px**, which keeps their concentric nesting exact
  (panel 16 = item 12 + the 4px `p-1` inset). The `--kun-radius-scale` runtime knob
  still multiplies on top, and `none` / `full` still don't scale.

  One component needed a fix at the larger radius: **KunCheckBox**. Its small square
  box would look circular at a 12px token radius (12px ≈ half a 16–20px box), so the
  box now uses a proportional `35%` radius — a rounded square at every size, never a
  circle (matching how HeroUI derives its checkbox radius). The radio-look variant
  stays a full circle. No other component needed a size change; pill/circle controls
  (chips, avatars, switch, slider) are unaffected.

### Patch Changes

- bef6580: Add a runtime `--kun-radius-scale` knob for corner radius.

  The scalable radius tokens (`sm` / `md` / `lg`) now multiply their base by
  `var(--kun-radius-scale, 1)`, so a consumer can drive **every** KunUI corner at
  once from a single CSS variable — live, with no re-render and no config change:

  ```css
  :root {
    --kun-radius-scale: 0;
  } /* square corners everywhere */
  :root {
    --kun-radius-scale: 1.5;
  } /* 50% rounder everywhere   */
  ```

  The default (`1`) leaves everything unchanged. `none` and `full` deliberately
  don't scale (a square stays square; a pill stays a pill). Because
  `--kun-radius-scale` is a separate, consumer-owned variable that the token
  `calc()` reads, it avoids the cascade-order trap of trying to override
  `--radius-kun-*` directly. (Small controls clamp `border-radius` to ~half their
  height, so a button can't get rounder than a pill — by design.)

### Patch Changes

- 24de30a: Fix floating layers (popover / tooltip / modal / dropdown / drawer / select /
  context-menu / alert / message) stacking at `auto` and getting covered by
  positioned elements (carousels, sticky headers) in some consumer builds.

  The `z-kun-*` z-index utilities deref a `@theme` variable with no fallback
  (`z-index: var(--z-kun-popover)`). Tailwind v4 only emits a `@theme` variable to
  `:root` when its tree-shaker considers it "used", and a custom `@utility`
  referencing the var does not reliably count as usage across consumer
  builds/versions — so `--z-kun-*` can be dropped from `:root`, leaving
  `z-index: var(<undefined>)` → no z-index. Each utility now carries a literal
  fallback (e.g. `var(--z-kun-popover, 9300)`), so the z-index always resolves;
  a consumer's `:root { --z-kun-*: … }` override still wins when present.
