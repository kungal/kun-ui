# @kungal/ui-core

## 0.2.4

### Patch Changes

- 0ec98f9: Fix invisible outline variants (`bordered` / `faded` / `ghost`) and the
  off-center checkbox check.

  - **Variant table**: entries set `border-{color}` but never a border _width_ —
    which paints nothing in Tailwind v4, so `bordered` / `faded` / `ghost` showed
    no border on KunButton, KunChip and KunDropdown. Every variant now carries an
    explicit `border` width (transparent on `solid` / `light` / `flat` / `shadow`
    so box sizes stay uniform when switching variants), so the outline variants
    render again.
  - **KunCheckBox**: the checkmark was a full-size (1em) icon nudged down by its
    baseline offset, so it sat off-center and cramped the 20px box edge-to-edge.
    It's now an explicitly-sized 14px check centered with flexbox.
